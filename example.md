- abstract:: A parametric model is developed to fit English league and cup [[football]] data from 1992 to 1995. The model is motivated by an aim to exploit potential inefficiencies in the [[association football]] [[betting]] market, and this is examined using bookmakers' odds from 1995 to 1996. The technique used is based on a [[[[poisson]] regression model]] but is complicated by the data structure and dynamic nature of teams' performances. [[maximum likelihood]] estimates are shown to me computationally obtainable, and the model is shown to have a positive return when used as the basis of a betting strategy.
